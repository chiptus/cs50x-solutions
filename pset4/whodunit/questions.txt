1.  A library defining new types on integers, that enhance the portability of software
2.  These integer types are guaranteed to have the same number of bits across all implementations. This allows portability.
3.  1, 4, 4, 2
4.  BM
5.  bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file and biSize is the number of bytes required by BITMAPINFOHEADER
6.  if biHeight is negative then the bitmap is a top down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner (DIB - device independnet bitmap)
7.  biBitCount
8.  fopen will return NULL when it's not successful. If mode is 'r', it will return NULL if the file doesn't exist. 
    In line 32 the mode is 'w' i.e write. It's not stated in the reference why it might returns NULL, but I guess it would happen because of file permission.
9.  the third argument to 'fread' is the number of times to read from the file. we use 1 since we want to read the requested block just once
10. 3
